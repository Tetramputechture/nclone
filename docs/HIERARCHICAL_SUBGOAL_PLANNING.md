# Hierarchical Subgoal Planning System Using Reachability Analysis

## Overview

This document describes how our optimized OpenCV reachability system integrates into a hierarchical subgoal planning framework for Deep RL training. The system provides approximate but fast level completion heuristics that guide RL agents toward optimal strategies.

## üéØ Core Heuristic: Level Completion Strategy

Our level completion heuristic follows a recursive switch-finding algorithm:

### 1. Exit Switch Reachability Analysis
```
IF exit_switch is reachable:
    ‚Üí Set subgoal: Navigate to exit switch
    ‚Üí Proceed to step 2
ELSE:
    ‚Üí Find required locked door switches to make exit switch reachable
    ‚Üí This may require recursive analysis for multi-switch dependencies
    ‚Üí Set subgoal: Navigate to required switch(es)
    ‚Üí Re-evaluate after switch activation
```

### 2. Exit Door Reachability Analysis  
```
IF exit_door is reachable:
    ‚Üí Set subgoal: Navigate to exit door
    ‚Üí Complete level
ELSE:
    ‚Üí Find required locked door switches to make exit door reachable
    ‚Üí Same recursive operation as step 1
    ‚Üí Set subgoal: Navigate to required switch(es)
    ‚Üí Re-evaluate after switch activation
```

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Integration with Tiered Reachability System

Our hierarchical planner leverages the three-tier reachability system:

- **Tier 1 (Ultra-fast <1ms)**: Real-time subgoal validation during execution
- **Tier 2 (Medium <10ms)**: Subgoal planning and switch dependency analysis  
- **Tier 3 (Detailed <100ms)**: Critical decision making for complex switch sequences
