## Handling Complex Levels and Advanced Scenarios

### Complex Multi-Stage Levels ✅ **Leverages Existing Graph Infrastructure**

The nclone codebase already includes sophisticated infrastructure for handling complex levels with multiple objectives and locked door dependencies:

**Existing Hierarchical Planning System:**
- `ReachabilityAnalyzer`: Physics-based analysis that identifies reachable areas from current ninja position
- `SubgoalPlanner`: Creates hierarchical plans for multi-step objectives with dependency analysis
- `GraphConstructor`: Builds player-centric graphs that only include actually reachable positions

**LLM Integration Strategy for Complex Levels:**

```
Initial Analysis → Switch/Door Mapping → Dependency Graph → Hierarchical Plan → Execution
     ↓                    ↓                   ↓                ↓              ↓
Visual Recognition → Entity Relationships → Goal Ordering → Phased Commands → Progress Monitoring
```

#### Multi-Stage Level Completion Algorithm

```python
async def complete_complex_level():
    level_state = {
        'switches_activated': set(),
        'doors_opened': set(),
        'current_phase': 'initial_analysis',
        'reachable_areas': set(),
        'failed_attempts': []
    }
    
    while not level_complete():
        # 1. Export current frame for visual analysis
        frame_path = f"analysis_frame_{level_state['current_phase']}.png"
        await export_current_frame(frame_path)
        
        # 2. Analyze current reachable areas and objectives
        analysis = await llm_analyze_current_state(frame_path, level_state)
        
        # 3. Identify next subgoal based on dependencies
        next_objective = identify_next_objective(analysis, level_state)
        
        # 4. Generate command sequence for current subgoal
        commands = await llm_generate_commands_for_objective(
            frame_path, next_objective, level_state
        )
        
        # 5. Execute with progress monitoring
        result = await execute_with_monitoring(commands, next_objective)
        
        # 6. Update level state based on results
        update_level_state(level_state, result, next_objective)
        
        # 7. Handle failures and replanning
        if result['status'] == 'failed':
            await handle_failure_and_replan(level_state, result)
```

**Visual Analysis for Complex Levels:**

The LLM needs to identify and understand:
- **Switch Types and Locations**: Regular switches, locked door switches, trap door switches
- **Door Dependencies**: Which switches control which doors
- **Area Accessibility**: What becomes reachable after each switch activation
- **Hazard Patterns**: Moving enemies, timed elements, spatial hazards
- **Optimal Sequencing**: Most efficient order for objective completion

### Stuck State Detection and Recovery ⚠️ **Critical Safety System**

Unlike death states (which are obvious), stuck states require sophisticated detection mechanisms:

#### Stuck State Classification

**Type 1: Physical Traps**
- Ninja alive but cannot move in any direction
- Surrounded by solid walls or hazards
- Detection: Position unchanged + all movement actions fail

**Type 2: Infinite Loops**
- Ninja moving but returning to same positions
- Common in slope areas or bounce block configurations
- Detection: Position history cycling through same coordinates

**Type 3: Unreachable Objectives**  
- Ninja can move but cannot reach required objectives
- May occur due to one-way passages or missing switch activation
- Detection: Movement possible but no progress toward goals

**Type 4: Timing Traps**
- Ninja waiting for moving elements but timing never aligns
- Common with drone patterns or moving platforms
- Detection: Extended periods of minimal movement

#### Stuck State Detection Algorithm

```python

recovery_strategies = {
    'physical_trap': [
        'wall_jump_sequence',  # Try all wall jump combinations
        'slope_navigation',    # Look for slope exits

## Conclusion and Recommendation

The multimodal LLM approach is **highly recommended** as a parallel research direction to the existing RL strategy, with enhanced confidence for complex level scenarios. The combination of:

1. **Robust existing infrastructure** (MCP server, simulation, hierarchical graph analysis)
2. **Sophisticated planning capabilities** (`ReachabilityAnalyzer`, `SubgoalPlanner`, dependency tracking)
3. **Suitable problem characteristics** (visual, discrete actions, hierarchical objectives)
4. **Mature multimodal LLM capabilities** (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet with complex reasoning)
5. **Comprehensive failure handling** (stuck state detection, recovery strategies)

Makes this approach both **technically feasible for complex scenarios and strategically valuable**. The LLM approach offers faster development cycles, higher interpretability, and potentially superior generalization compared to traditional RL methods, especially for complex multi-stage levels.
