# Graph Debug Implementation - Complete Summary

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Pixel-Perfect Edge Sampling ✓
**File**: `tile_connectivity_precomputer.py`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Increased sampling density** from 5 samples to 11 samples for cardinal directions
   - Old: offsets [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4] = 8 pixels covered
   - New: range(-10, 11, 2) = 11 samples covering full 20-pixel ninja diameter
   
2. **Require ALL points clear** instead of ANY point clear
   - Old: `traversable_count > 0` (30% threshold before that)
   - New: `traversable_count == total_points` (100% of samples must be clear)
   
3. **Edge case handling** for sub-nodes too close to tile boundaries
   - If less than 50% of expected samples fit, connection is blocked
   
4. **Diagonal sampling** with L-shape pattern
   - Samples both edges that meet at corner
   - Ensures full corner clearance for diagonal movement

**Results**:
- Traversability dropped from 49.7% to 14.6% (much stricter)
- Solid tiles (Type 1) show 0.0% traversability ✓
- Empty tiles (Type 0) show 37.2% traversability (valid paths remain)

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Debug Tools ✓

**Created 4 new debug tools**:

#### 1. `nclone/tools/debug_tile_connectivity.py`
- Analyzes the precomputed 5D connectivity table
- Shows traversability by tile type and direction
- Identifies suspicious connections
- Usage: `python nclone/tools/debug_tile_connectivity.py`

#### 2. `nclone/tools/detailed_graph_debug.py`
- Analyzes actual graph building from environment
- Counts nodes and edges by tile type
- Identifies problematic diagonal connections
- Usage: `python nclone/tools/detailed_graph_debug.py [MAP_ID]`

#### 3. `nclone/tools/visualize_tile_edges.py`
- ASCII visualization of tile-level connectivity
- Shows which tiles have nodes (X = nodes, . = solid)
- Counts cross-tile edges by direction
- Usage: `python nclone/tools/visualize_tile_edges.py [MAP_ID]`

#### 4. `nclone/tools/visualize_sample_points.py` (partially complete)
- Visualizes exact sample points for specific connections
- Helps identify sampling gaps
- Usage: `python nclone/tools/visualize_sample_points.py TILE_A TILE_B DIRECTION ...`

### Phase 3: Enhanced Debug Logging ✓
**File**: `fast_graph_builder.py`

**Changes Made**:
1. Added detailed logging for traversability decisions
2. Added kwargs support for extra debug info
3. Added logging for blocked edges (geometry, connectivity, diagonal)
4. Added verbose_debug mode for logging allowed edges too

## What Was Verified

### Tile-Level Analysis (Map 0) ✓
- **Tiles**: 102 empty, 864 solid
- **Nodes**: 408 sub-nodes (102 tiles × 4 = 408) ✓
- **Edges**: 2,992 total, 1,768 cross-tile
- **Cross-tile connections**: ALL are Type 0 → Type 0 ✓
- **Impossible connections**: NONE found at tile level ✓

### Connectivity Table Analysis ✓
- **Total combinations**: 147,968
- **Traversable**: 21,672 (14.6%)
- **Empty → Empty**: Allows all 16 sub-node combinations ✓
- **Empty → Solid**: 0 connections ✓
- **Solid → Any**: 0 connections ✓

## Current Status

### What's Working ✓
1. Pixel-perfect sampling with 11 points per cardinal direction
2. Zero-tolerance requirement (all points must be clear)
3. No connections to/from/through solid tiles at tile level
4. Comprehensive debug tools for analysis

### User's Reported Issue ⚠
"There are still issues with letting between-tile connectivity be too permissive."

### Analysis
The debug tools show NO impossible connections at the **tile level**, but the user's images suggest connections exist that shouldn't. This indicates the issue is likely:

1. **Sub-node placement** near tile boundaries causing ninja overlap into adjacent solid geometry
2. **Complex tile geometry** (half-tiles, slopes) where sampling misses thin solid regions
3. **Within-tile connectivity** allowing movement through solid portions of complex tiles
4. **Diagonal intermediate checks** not catching all cases

## Files Modified

1. `nclone/graph/reachability/tile_connectivity_precomputer.py`
   - Updated `_get_edge_sample_points()` for dense sampling
   - Updated `_check_traversability()` for ALL-points-clear requirement
   - Updated `print_statistics()` for correct tuple unpacking

2. `nclone/graph/reachability/fast_graph_builder.py`
   - Enhanced debug logging in `_is_sub_node_traversable()`
   - Added kwargs support to `_debug_log_traversability_decision()`
   - Added detailed blocking reason logging

3. `nclone/data/tile_connectivity.pkl.gz`
   - Regenerated with new pixel-perfect sampling
   - Size: 1.45 KB (compressed)
   - Traversability: 14.6%

4. `SUB_NODE_AWARE_CONNECTIVITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
   - Updated with pixel-perfect edge sampling section
   - Documented the fix and results

5. Created new files:
   - `nclone/tools/debug_tile_connectivity.py`
   - `nclone/tools/detailed_graph_debug.py`
   - `nclone/tools/visualize_tile_edges.py`
   - `nclone/tools/visualize_sample_points.py`
   - `GRAPH_DEBUG_TOOLS_SUMMARY.md`
   - `GRAPH_DEBUG_NEXT_STEPS.md`
   - `GRAPH_DEBUG_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (this file)

## Next Steps for User

To identify and fix the remaining issue, please:

1. **Run the test environment** and capture the problematic areas:
   ```bash
   python nclone/test_environment.py --map 0 --visualize-adjacency-graph
   ```

2. **Identify specific problematic coordinates**:
   - Note tile positions (x, y) where nodes shouldn't exist
   - Note tile types involved (run detailed_graph_debug.py to see types)
   - Identify one specific impossible edge (source → destination)

3. **Run debug tools**:
   ```bash
   python nclone/tools/detailed_graph_debug.py 0
   python nclone/tools/visualize_tile_edges.py 0
   ```

4. **Provide feedback**:
   - Which areas show impossible connections?
   - Are they near tile boundaries?
   - Are they involving specific tile types (half-tiles, slopes)?
   - Are they diagonal connections?

With this specific information, we can pinpoint the exact cause and implement a targeted fix.

## Possible Next Fixes

Based on the most likely hypotheses:

### Option A: Stricter sub-node boundary checking
Check if sub-nodes are too close to adjacent solid tiles and block them.

### Option B: Ninja-radius-aware clearance checks
Verify full 10-pixel ninja radius has clearance, not just the sub-node center.

### Option C: Increased sampling density
If gaps remain, sample every pixel instead of every 2 pixels.

### Option D: Geometry-specific handling
Add special handling for complex tile types (half-tiles, slopes, circles).
