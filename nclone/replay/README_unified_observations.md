# Unified Observation System Integration

## Overview

The binary replay parsing system has been integrated with the NppEnvironment observation system to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency between training data and replay data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Unified Observation Extractor (`unified_observation_extractor.py`)

- **Purpose**: Bridges replay simulation and training observation formats
- **Key Features**:
  - Reuses NppEnvironment's standardized observation extraction methods
  - **Full reachability feature integration** - extracts 64-dimensional reachability features using the same logic as NppEnvironment
  - **Strict error handling** - raises exceptions instead of silent fallbacks when reachability extraction fails
  - Supports both raw and processed observation formats
  - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy JSONL format
  - Configurable visual observation extraction (disabled for replay parsing to save computation)
  - Caching system for reachability features to improve performance

### 2. Updated Simulation Manager (`simulation_manager.py`)

- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `NinjaStateExtractor` with `UnifiedObservationExtractor`
  - Simplified frame data generation using unified system
  - Maintained existing JSONL output format for compatibility

### 3. Removed Redundant Code

- **Deleted**: `ninja_state_extractor.py` (redundant with NppEnvironment methods)
- **Benefit**: Eliminated code duplication and maintenance burden

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Replay data now uses the same observation extraction logic as training
2. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for observation processing
3. **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing npp-rl training pipeline
4. **Future-proof**: Automatic adoption of any improvements made to NppEnvironment observations

## Integration Test Results

The integration was verified with comprehensive tests:

- ✅ Raw observation extraction works correctly
- ✅ Game state format matches expectations (30+ features, normalized to [-1,1])
- ✅ **Reachability features properly extracted** (64-dimensional float32 vectors)
- ✅ **Exception handling works correctly** - no silent fallbacks on failures
- ✅ Processed observations compatible with training pipeline
- ✅ Legacy JSONL format maintained for backward compatibility
- ✅ Observation keys and shapes match NppEnvironment exactly
- ✅ Simulation manager integration successful

## Usage

The unified system is automatically used when running binary replay parsing:

```bash
python -m nclone.replay.binary_replay_parser --input replays/ --output datasets/raw/
```

No changes are required to existing replay parsing workflows - the integration is transparent to end users while providing the benefits of unified observation processing.

## Technical Details

### Observation Flow

1. **Raw Extraction**: `extract_raw_observation()` uses NPlayHeadless methods to get standardized game state
2. **Processing**: `extract_processed_observation()` applies ObservationProcessor for training-ready format  
3. **Legacy Format**: `extract_legacy_frame_data()` maintains existing JSONL structure for compatibility

### Performance Considerations

- Visual observations are disabled by default for replay parsing (configurable)
- Observation processor augmentation is disabled for replay data
- Minimal computational overhead compared to previous implementation

## Future Enhancements

With this unified system in place, future improvements to NppEnvironment observations (such as enhanced reachability features or better entity proximity calculations) will automatically benefit replay data processing as well.
