# Task List

1. âœ… Analyze current codebase and understand Task 3.2 requirements
Analyzed codebase structure, found existing graph builder, conditional edges, and environment wrappers. Task 3.2 needs dynamic graph adaptation with event-driven updates.
2. âœ… Design event-driven update system architecture
Designed comprehensive architecture with EventType, GraphEvent, UpdateBudget, TemporalEdge, DynamicConstraintPropagator, and DynamicGraphWrapper classes
3. âœ… Implement dynamic graph wrapper with event-driven updates
Implemented complete DynamicGraphWrapper with event-driven updates, computational budgets, and temporal edge management
4. âœ… Implement dynamic constraint propagation system
Implemented DynamicConstraintPropagator with priority-based updates and constraint dependency tracking
5. âœ… Integrate dynamic graph system with existing environment
Created integration utilities with performance modes, monitoring, validation, and benchmarking capabilities
6. âœ… Create comprehensive tests for real-time graph adaptation
Created comprehensive test suite covering all components, performance benchmarks, and integration tests
7. ðŸ”„ Validate performance and create PR
Need to run tests, validate performance requirements, and create pull request
