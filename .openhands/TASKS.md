# Task List

1. ✅ Analyze thwump and bounce block entity behaviors
Examined entity definitions - thwumps have safe sides/back, bounce blocks are fully traversable platforms
2. ✅ Enhance entity traversability logic in graph builder
Added directional traversability for thwumps, platform behavior for bounce blocks, and entity-aware sub-cell traversability
3. ✅ Update HGT entity type system with improved behaviors
Added CONDITIONAL category for directionally hazardous entities, updated thwump categorization
4. 🔄 Implement directional edge creation for complex entities
Create edges that respect entity-specific safe zones and platform behaviors
5. ⏳ Test enhanced entity behavior integration
Validate that graph accurately represents entity traversability
6. ⏳ Create pull request with entity behavior improvements
Document improvements and create PR for review
