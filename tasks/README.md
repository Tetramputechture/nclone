# nclone Tasks

This directory contains individual task definitions for implementing the N++ Deep RL project components in the nclone repository. Each task is a self-contained work item with detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and test scenarios.

## Task Overview

### TASK_001: Remove Deprecated Pathfinding Components
**Status**: Ready to start  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days  
**Dependencies**: None  

Remove all deprecated pathfinding-related files and tests, as the comprehensive technical roadmap has determined that physics-aware reachability analysis is sufficient and more efficient than full A* pathfinding.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Remove ~15 pathfinding-related files
- Update documentation to reflect reachability-focused approach
- Ensure no broken imports remain
- Preserve reachability analysis components

### TASK_002: Create Test Maps for Reachability Analysis
**Status**: Ready to start  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Dependencies**: N++ level editor access  

Create a comprehensive set of 15 specialized test maps designed to validate reachability analysis functionality across all N++ mechanics.

**Key Deliverables**:
- 15 test maps covering all scenarios (basic physics, dynamic entities, switch puzzles, performance testing)
- Complete documentation for each map
- Integration with existing `map_loader.py`
- Expected reachability results for validation

### TASK_003: Enhance Reachability System for RL Integration
**Status**: Depends on TASK_001  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks  
**Dependencies**: TASK_001 completion, TASK_002 test maps  

Enhance the existing reachability analysis system to better support RL agent needs, including performance optimizations, caching improvements, and additional analysis capabilities.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Performance optimizations (<10ms analysis time)
- Enhanced caching system (>80% hit rate)
- Subgoal identification for HRL
- Frontier detection for curiosity
- RL-specific API interface

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Prerequisites
1. **Development Environment**: Ensure nclone development environment is set up
2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Verify test runner and dependencies are available
3. **Documentation Tools**: Have access to documentation generation tools
4. **Level Editor**: For TASK_002, ensure N++ level editor is available

### Execution Order
The tasks should generally be executed in order due to dependencies:

1. **TASK_001** (Remove Pathfinding) - Clean up deprecated code first
2. **TASK_002** (Create Test Maps) - Can be done in parallel with TASK_001
3. **TASK_003** (Enhance Reachability) - Requires clean codebase and test maps

### Quality Standards
Each task must meet the following standards:
- **Functional Requirements**: All specified functionality implemented and tested
- **Technical Requirements**: Performance and memory targets met
- **Quality Requirements**: Code quality, documentation, and testing standards met
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance tests

### Cross-Repository Coordination
These tasks coordinate with corresponding tasks in the npp-rl repository:
- **nclone TASK_003** provides enhanced reachability system
- **npp-rl TASK_002** integrates the reachability system with RL architecture
- **npp-rl TASK_003** uses reachability for hierarchical RL

## Reference Documentation

### Master Document
All tasks reference the comprehensive technical roadmap:
`../npp-rl/docs/comprehensive_technical_roadmap.md`

This document contains:
- Overall project architecture and strategy
- Detailed technical analysis of reachability vs pathfinding
- Integration strategies between simulation and RL components
- Complete testing and validation framework

### Key Sections Referenced

- **Integration**: Seamless integration with npp-rl RL architecture
- **Quality**: >90% test coverage, comprehensive documentation
- **Functionality**: All 33 tile types and dynamic entities handled correctly

### Individual Task Success
Each task has specific success metrics defined in its task file. Key metrics include:
- **TASK_001**: Clean removal of pathfinding code, no broken imports
- **TASK_002**: 15 comprehensive test maps, complete documentation
- **TASK_003**: <10ms reachability queries, >80% cache hit rate
